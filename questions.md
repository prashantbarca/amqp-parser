- What is the overall goal of the parser?
- What should the parser be detecting?
- Are the values given from the jasonpayloaddata similar to what we would recieve from any payload?
- How many events will be in each dataset? (in the one given there was 29)
- is the sensor ID's consistant?
  - If not, will each event have the similar endings to the sensorID? (i.e. xxx.0.1 or xxx.rtd)
- Are the ranges similar to what we would get from any payloaddata file?
